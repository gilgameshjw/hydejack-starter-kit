Starting from a blue sky project, within 6 months, I could identify, test, train and integrate models and data architecture components that became the core of currently the best weather model predictions on the market."},{"company":"Interscript","position":"Contractor","startDate":"Sep 2021","endDate":"Jun 2022","summary":"Interscript needed to use deep learning for diacritization and transliteration. Diacritization models were trained in arabic and hebrew, resp. reproducing and beating existing benchmarks. A new approach to transliteration allows now language experts to design the complex business rules necessary to generate the transliteration rules being put into production via data generation and the training of transformer architectures. The approach was presented in a small specialists conference."},{"company":"Neurotrophic Labs","position":"Co-Founder","startDate":"Jun 2019","endDate":"Aug 2021","summary":"With a Californian MD, we have developed an app allowing practitioner to easily model patient states and diseases and retrieve statistical evidences in real time via fuzzy search throughout the US healthcare dataset.
