# Work & Interests

During my career, I have been interested and worked extensively on the topics below, on which I consider myself an expert.
Working on these topics, unique software solutions have been created or often, latest existing benchmarks have been reproduced and beaten.

Among other highlights of my career, the work on the topics below is illustrated under the **Current and Past Work** section of the website.

## Deep Learning for Weather Predictions

With JUA, we have adapted latet existing research to productionise a novel end-to-end AI system for global weather prediction. 

We have worked with Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), Graph Neural Networks and 
Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to currently operate the most accurate precipitation weather model.

I am currently working on porting the FNO architecture to text processing and enhancing it. 


## Conversational Agents

Since 2016, I have worked on conversational agents working in R&D for Constellation AI.

IVA was developed with Markus Thora and Denis Okyere and was an end to end webapp integrating 
speech to a brain using HD computing to model conversational sequences. 

With Humbaba I and II and my some of my work with Interscript, 
I am building on the idea of software designed as "Union of conversational Agents".

Aside of the fun and elegant design, there are the need to allow 
people with little experience in software engineering to design software
and the need to design smart system to allow for an interesting and smart interaction...

My work is the design of:
* conversational interfaces
* graphical design of software (with simple technologies like lucidchart, etc...)
* software design automation combining the above ideas with advanced language models


## High Dimensional computing

Learning and computations can be accelerated using sparse binary vectors. 
I have worked on various technologies exploiting the benefits of the HD approach:

* combine semantic vectors with symbolic algebra 
* simpler operations mean compression and more efficient compute
* graphs and rules encoding/modelling



## Collaborative Systems

TaxiQ is an app developed for giving London's black cab drivers a real time overview over the taxi ranks.
I have helped faxi (now kinto join) with recommendations, carpooling modelling and community evaluations via an app. Highlights are IMO:

* optimisation and behavioural simulations
* efficient GPS modelling and retrieval
* real time city modelling in c++
