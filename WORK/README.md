# Work & Interests

During my career, I have worked extensively on the topics below, on which I have developed as an expert.
Working on these topics, unique software solutions have been created or latest existing benchmarks have been reproduced and beaten.

My past and current work is described with more details under the **Current and Past Work** section of the website.

## Neuro Inspired Computing

#### Generative Models Deep for various Business cases

With JUA, we have adapted Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), Graph Neural Networks and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to currently operate the most accurate precipitation weather model.

I am currently working on porting the FNO architecture to text processing. 

For Interscript, I have built generative model leveraging transformer architecture for not only transliteration but also semi automatised code production and data generation.

#### High Dimensional computing

Learning and computations can be accelerated using sparse binary vectors. 
I have worked on various technologies exploiting the benefits of the HD approach:

* combine semantic vectors with symbolic algebra 
* simpler operations mean compression and more efficient compute
* graphs and rules encoding/modelling
* Interplay HDC / Deep Learning

This work has been applied to multiple business cases like text processing, patient profiles modelling as well as fuzzy GPS trajectory modelling and matching.


## Systems

#### Conversational Agents

Since 2016, I have worked on conversational agents, starting with my R&D work for Constellation AI.

IVA was developed with Markus Thora and Denis Okyere as an end to end IO app allowing speech interactions with a logic compressed into a brain using HD computing combined with a language model. 

With Humbaba I and II and my some of my work with Interscript, 
I am building on the idea of software designed as "Union of conversational Agents". Such ideas are made more realistic by the newest language models (gpt's, ...).

Aside of the fun and elegant design, there are the need to allow 
people with little experience in software engineering to design software
and the need to design smart system to allow for an interesting and smart interaction...

My work consists in the design of:
* conversational interfaces
* graphical description of software (with simple technologies like lucidchart, etc...) and its automatised parsing and building
* software design automation combining the above ideas with advanced language models


#### Collaborative Systems

TaxiQ is an app developed for giving London's black cab drivers a real time overview over the taxi ranks.
I have also helped faxi (now kinto join) with recommendations, GPS processing algorithms and community evaluations via an app. 
highlights are IMO:

* optimisation and behavioural simulations
* efficient GPS modelling and retrieval
* real time city modelling in c++


#### Fuzzy retrieval

High dimensional computing and encoding has been used to model and retrieve matching GPS trajectories, text snippet and medical data.
