# JUA AI

Jua is introducing deep learning into the weather model market and applications: [jua website](https://www.jua.ai/)



### My Work

* Literature review and models prototyping and testing (graph and Fourier Neural Operator NNets)
* Data engineering and modelling
* Model training on distributed GPU's (~40 TB). 

### Paper
A publication where I am co-author is currently under review in American Meteorological Society.
