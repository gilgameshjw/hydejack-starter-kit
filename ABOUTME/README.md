# About Me

Throughout my life, I have been put in motion by intellectual interests and setting myself big challenges.

So I became a researcher in Particle Physics, where I could contribute to expand our knowledge of Nature. My journey is now continuing in the "real world", where I am using my skills and brain to solve interesting problems.

Along this new journey that started 10 years ago, I have been mainly interested in Neuro-inspired architectures like HD computing and Deep Learning and their applications as well as in the building of complex solutions like: Conversational Agents, Collaborative Systems, Retrieval Engines, Automatised Software Generation and Generative Models.


### Highlights: 

* 12 co-publications in numerical particle physics, collaborating with medium size teams
* 3 self founded Startups (TaxiQ, Plex AI,  Neurotrophic Labs) and as many collaborations
* Early collaborations with some of the most ambitious and best financed european startups (Dataffirm, Constellation AI, Media Players, Jua AI) 
* Over 10 documents in publication format (latex) featuring among others a recent publication (2023) of the currently most accurate precipitation weather model
* the building of several innovative technologies (TaxiQ, HD encoder for SDR's, Neurotrophic Labs patient modelling and search, Humbaba, transliteration learner from graph, ...)
