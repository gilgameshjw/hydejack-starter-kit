    summary:  
      Consulting in data science for more than 20 entities, 
      including well established companies and well founded startups. 
      Some of the work is described in Portfolio

      * Instrumental in the development of a weather model at currently unseen accuracy and resolution with JUA

      * Brough AI within the space of transliteration, porting a graphical editor and char and word level transformers into production

      * Creation of own original technologies like Humbaba, IVA, neurotrophic Labs

      * Co-creation of several companies as TaxiQ, neurotrophic Labs, Plex AI

      * Collaboration with early stages startups as Dataffirm, Mediaplayers, Faxi, Constellation AI, Guesser, JUA AI, ...

      * Contracting with small and large entities as Interscript, Conde Nast, Toyota, Just Eat, ...
      

        #* While main focus on the application and development of brain inspired technologies, 
        #we have a solid expertise in machine / deep / reinforcement learning, 
        #financial math and statistics as well as some physics.

        #* We have years of practical expertise working with natural language processing, 
        #bots, GPS, collaborative and recommender systems, as well as with huge datasets and 
        #a long list of standard technologies and libraries (spark, aws, sklearn, pytorch, ...)."

    startDate: "May 2022"
    endDate: "Mar 2023"
    summary: "I was invited by JUA.AI to build advanced weather models using deep learning. 
    Starting from a blue sky project, within 6 months, I could identify, test, train and integrate 
    models and data architecture components that became the core of currently the best 
    weather model predictions on the market."

    startDate: "Sep 2021"
    endDate: "Jun 2022"
    summary: "Interscript needed to use deep learning for diacritization and transliteration.
    Diacritization models were trained in arabic and hebrew, resp. reproducing and beating existing benchmarks.
    A new approach to transliteration allows now language experts to design the complex business rules 
    necessary to generate the transliteration rules being put into production via
    data generation and the training of transformer architectures. 
    The approach was presented in a small specialists conference."
